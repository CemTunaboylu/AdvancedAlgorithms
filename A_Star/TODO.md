        - `getattr(obj, "string_repr_of_attribute")`
        - `setattr(obj, attrname, value)`
        - Note: Comparisons sometimes involve calling user-defined code using `.__lt__()`. 
        - Calling user-defined methods in Python is a relatively slow operation compared to other 
        - operations done in a heap, so this will usually be the bottleneck.

- Operating on a string map 
- Getting the dimensions of the grid. Now we assume that start and target points are each at one corner of the grid
